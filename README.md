##### R5 - Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that my application will adhere to.
I have applied the standard style guide for Python: PEP 8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

The following conventions are adhered to in accordance with this style guide:

* Indentation - 4 spaces used for each level of indentation consistently throughout your code.
* Line length - lines are limited to 79 characters whereever possible.
* Naming conventions - I have used snake_case for functions and variables (add_task, start_task) and CamelCase for classes (ProductivityTracker, Task).
* Imports - libraries used listed on separate lines at the top of my file.


#### R6 - List of features included in the application:
